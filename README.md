# VEX-In The Zone-Termitator
VEX In The Zone Lifting Machine
# Details
The program designed to lift the cones fastly and accurately. Using least energy and motors to accomplish the whole procedure.

The most advanced technology that I use is the second version of dynamic power control for moving and lifting which allows robot to get points in a considerable speed. I program to calculate encoder speed in time in order to decrease the voltage at low speed, minimizing the current. With the use of PID and TANH curve of voltage control, the motor had never been broken down by overheating problem. 

In addition, automation system for mannual control significantly reduce operator's pressure and minimize mistakes, since one mistakes will cause the whole competition defeated. The auto-load automation allows operator only need one press to control 6 different motors at the same time.

The auto capture system which were adapted from system by Mr. Luo gave our robots ability to save and replay the auto route. It helped us win the first place in programming skill competition in West China VEX Tournament.
